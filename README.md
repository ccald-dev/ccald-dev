🔍 About Me

I'm a results-driven Analytics Engineer 📈 with 
deep experience turning raw data into strategic insights that fuel growth 📊 and 
product innovation 🧠. 

I build end-to-end data solutions—from scalable data pipelines and modern stacks (🛠️ SQL, dbt, Snowflake, Python) to intuitive dashboards (📊 Power BI, 📈 Tableau, 📉 Looker Studio)—that help startups move fast and make confident, data-informed decisions ⚡.

Having led initiatives at both high-growth startups 🚀 and established companies 🏢, I know how to balance scrappy execution with long-term scalability. Whether it’s improving user retention 🔁, optimizing product funnels 🧪, or automating reporting workflows 🤖, I bring a mix of technical expertise, business acumen, and a strong bias for action 🔧.
